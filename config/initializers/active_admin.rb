ActiveAdmin.setup do |config|
  # == Site Title
  #
  # Set the title that is displayed on the main layout
  # for each of the Active Admin pages.
  #
  config.site_title = "Presence Board Admin"

  # Set the link url for the title. For example, to take
  # users to your main site. Defaults to no link.
  #
  # config.site_title_link = "/"

  # Set an optional image to be displayed for the header
  # instead of a string (overrides :site_title)
  #
  # Note: Aim for an image that's 21px high so it fits in the header.
  # config.site_title_image = "logo.png"

  # == Default Namespace
  #
  # Set the default namespace when a user does not specify a
  # namespace in the URL.
  #
  # Default:
  # config.default_namespace = :admin
  #
  # You can customize the settings for each namespace by using
  # a namespace block. For example, to change the site title
  # within a namespace:
  #
  #   config.namespace :admin do |admin|
  #     admin.site_title = "Custom Admin Title"
  #   end
  #
  # This will ONLY change the title for the admin namespace. Other
  # namespaces will continue to use the "Presence Board Admin" title.

  # == User Authentication
  #
  # Active Admin will automatically call an authentication
  # method in a before filter of all controller actions to
  # ensure that there is a currently logged in admin user.
  #
  # This setting changes the method which Active Admin calls
  # within the application controller.
  config.authentication_method = :authenticate_admin_user!

  # == User Authorization
  #
  # Active Admin will automatically call an authorization
  # method in a before filter of all controller actions to
  # ensure that there is a user with proper rights. You can use
  # CanCanAdapter or make your own. Please refer to documentation.
  # config.authorization_adapter = ActiveAdmin::CanCanAdapter

  # In case you prefer Pundit over other solutions you can here pass
  # the name of default policy class. This policy will be used in every
  # resource when you don't specify one.
  #
  # config.pundit_default_policy = "MyDefaultPunditPolicy"

  # You can customize your CanCan Ability class name here.
  # config.cancan_ability_class = "Ability"

  # You can specify a method to be called on unauthorized access.
  # This is necessary in order to prevent a redirect loop which happens
  # because, by default, user gets redirected to Dashboard. If user
  # doesn't have access to Dashboard, he'll be redirected back, which will
  # cause a redirect loop.
  # Method provided here should be defined in application_controller.rb as
  # a helper method.
  # config.on_unauthorized_access = :access_denied

  # == Current User
  #
  # Active Admin will associate actions with the current
  # user performing them.
  #
  # This setting changes the method which Active Admin calls
  # (within the application controller) to return the currently logged in user.
  config.current_user_method = :current_user

  # == Logging
  #
  # Whether to log each action performed by Active Admin.
  #
  # Note: ActiveAdmin uses Rails.logger by default, so no explicit logger configuration is needed.
  # config.logger = Rails.logger  # This option is not supported in ActiveAdmin

  # == Meta Tags
  #
  # Add <meta> tags to the rendered HTML. This can be used to set custom
  # browser titles, meta descriptions, keywords, etc.

  #
  #   config.meta_tags = {
  #     title: "My Custom Title",
  #     description: "My Custom Description",
  #     keywords: "Custom Keywords"
  #   }
  #
  # To add a meta tag only to a specific namespace, use the namespace's
  # config:
  #
  #   config.namespace :admin do |admin|
  #     admin.meta_tags = {
  #       title: "Admin Title"
  #     }
  #   end

  # == CSV options
  #
  # Set the CSV builder separator
  # config.csv_options = { col_sep: ';' }
  #
  # Force the use of quotes
  # config.csv_options = { force_quotes: true }

  # == Menu System
  #
  # You can add a navigation menu to be used in your application, or configure a provided menu
  #
  # To change the default utility navigation to show a link to your website & a logout btn
  #
  #   config.namespace :admin do |admin|
  #     admin.build_menu :utility_navigation do |menu|
  #       menu.add label: "My Great Website", url: "http://www.mygreatwebsite.com", html_options: { target: :blank }
  #       admin.add_logout_button_to_menu menu
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  # If you wanted to add a static menu item to the default menu provided:
  #
  #   config.namespace :admin do |admin|
  #     admin.build_menu :default do |menu|
  #       menu.add label: "My Custom Static Page", priority: 0
  #     end
  #   end

  # == Download Links
  #
  # You can disable download links on resource listing pages,
  # or customize the formats shown per namespace/globally
  #
  # To disable/customize for the :admin namespace:
  #
  #   config.namespace :admin do |admin|
  #     # Disable the links entirely
  #     admin.download_links = false
  #
  #     # Only show XML & PDF options
  #     admin.download_links = [:xml, :pdf]
  #
  #     # Enable/disable the links based on block
  #     #   (for example, with cancan)
  #     admin.download_links = proc { can?(:view_download_links) }
  #   end

  # == Pagination
  #
  # Pagination is enabled by default for all resources.
  # You can control the default per page count for all resources here.
  #
  # config.default_per_page = 30
  #
  # You can control the max per page count too.
  #
  # config.max_per_page = 10_000

  #
  # config.filters = true

  # You can hide the footer for all resources here.
  #
  # config.footer = false

  # == Sorting
  #
  # By default ActiveAdmin::OrderClause is used for sorting logic
  # You can inherit it with own class and inject it for all resources
  #
  # config.order_clause = MyOrderClause
end
